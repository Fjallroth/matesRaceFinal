// /controllers/userController.js
// This file is currently a placeholder as /api/user/me is handled by authController.
// If you add more user-specific routes (e.g., update profile, delete account),
// their handlers would go here.

// Example:
// export const updateUserProfile = async (req, res, next) => {
//   // ... logic to update user profile
// };
